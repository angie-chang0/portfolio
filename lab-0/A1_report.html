			<h2>Subtheme: fatal drug overdoses in Allegheny County’s Health Department</h2>

			<p>
				The provided dataset from Allegheny County Health Department includes 7,478 cases (denoted by the number of rows), with each case having 20 fields of data. The data sets panda from 2018 to mid 2025, with the latest record in June 2025. Some key variables include age, sex, and race for demographics. Location information includes incident_zip, and decedent_zip. In addition, case details such as death_date_and_time, case_year, manner_of_death. Finally, there are details about drug involvement, with up to 10 columns detailing the substances detected. 

			</p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What demographic groups are most affected by fatal overdoses in Allegheny County?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>ublic health reports often highlight disparities in overdose deaths by race, age, or gender. Recent CDC studies show overdose deaths rising disproportionately among middle-aged adults and some minority groups. Exploring this helps confirm or challenge those trends locally. </li>
				</ul>
				<li>How have overdose patterns changed over time?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>News stories suggest that fentanyl and synthetic opioids have sharply increased overdose risks in recent years. I want to see whether the county data reflects a surge around the pandemic period.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>What are the most common substances involved in fatal overdoses?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Policy discussions often focus on fentanyl, heroin, and polysubstance overdoses. Want to see whether drugs like cocaine, benzodiazepines, or newer synthetics appear alongside opioids could reveal changing trends in drug use.</li>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				<figcaption>
					Staring with a density plot looking at overdose rates and age, we show that fatal overdoses are heavily concentrated
					 among adults aged 25 to 55, with the density peaking in the early 30s and again
					  around the late 40s. This dual peak suggests that overdoses are not limited to
					   a single life stage but affect both younger and more middle-aged populations.
					    Very few cases occur under 20 or over 70, highlighting that the crisis is
						 most prevalent in working-age groups. The tapering after 60 also suggests a
						  decline in risk, though older individuals are not immune. This pattern
						   aligns with national opioid data, where fentanyl and polysubstance
						    overdoses are most prevalent among adults in their prime years.
							 It emphasizes the need for interventions targeted at both early
							  adulthood and middle-aged communities. I want to further investigate this, and perhaps look at how other demographic details (such as race, sex) play a role in shaping this data.

					Next, I wanted to explore the data temporally. This time-series chart reveals a clear escalation of overdose deaths beginning 
					around 2014–2015, peaking sharply between 2016 and 2017. This aligns with the 
					period when fentanyl and synthetic opioids surged into the drug supply, driving
					 unprecedented fatalities. After the peak, the number of overdoses fluctuates 
					 but remains elevated compared to pre-2014 levels, showing that the crisis has 
					 not returned to baseline. Notably, there are signs of renewed increases around 
					 2019–2021, possibly connected to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on drug use and 
					 access to care. Post-2022, the data suggests some decline, though it is unclear 
					 if this represents a sustained downward trend or temporary fluctuation. Overall, 
					 the visualization demonstrates how the overdose epidemic is both a long-term 
					 structural problem and one with distinct surges tied to external factors.

					Now we look at the dominant role of certain substances in 
					fatal overdoses. Fentanyl is by far the most frequently involved, with over 2,000 
					cases, making it the single largest driver of the crisis in Allegheny County. 
					Cocaine also shows a substantial presence, followed by alcohol, which appears in 
					more than 1,000 cases—often as a co-factor that increases overdose risk when mixed 
					with opioids. Heroin, once the leading opioid in overdose deaths, is still significant 
					but now falls behind fentanyl and cocaine. Prescription medications like  
					Xanax and Valium also appear regularly, underscoring the role of sedatives in 
					polysubstance overdoses. Overall, the chart confirms that while fentanyl dominates, 
					the crisis is not driven by a single substance, but rather by a combination of illicit
					 opioids, stimulants, alcohol, and sedatives, reflecting the growing complexity of 
					 polysubstance use.

					This chart highlights the racial and ethnic disparities in overdose deaths in 
					Allegheny County. White individuals account for the overwhelming majority of fatalities, 
					far surpassing all other groups, which mirrors national patterns where fentanyl and opioids 
					have disproportionately affected White populations. A question that arose while visualizing this data was if this prominent data point was due to the overall population of allegheny county being majority white, or if the results are unusually high. I would definitely want to look deeper into this. However, Black/African American 
					communities also show a substantial number of deaths, making them the second-most impacted 
					group, which raises concerns about rising overdose risks among minority populations in urban centers. 
					Hispanic/Latino and Asian groups are affected at much lower levels, but the presence of cases across nearly every 
					racial category demonstrates that the crisis cuts across demographic lines. 
					Overall, this visualization shows that while overdose deaths are not 
					exclusive to any one community, the burden falls most heavily on White and Black residents.

				<figcaption>
					Looking deeper at demographics with a within-race gender breakdown, males account for the majority
					of overdose deaths across every race group, around two-thirds of cases. 
					The female share varies by group, with roughly 30–35% among White, Black, and Asian decedents, 20–25% for 
					Multiracial and AI/AN, and lowest for Hispanic/Latino. The “Unknown” race category is 
					close to 50/50, although its hard to draw insights from this group due to ambiguity. This universal male skew is consistent with national 
					overdose patterns, but the degree of imbalance differs meaningfully by race, suggesting distinct risk environments or 
					substance profiles. This makes wonder, does the gap narrow in specific age bands or widen among younger adults? 
					Has the split shifted post-2020, and are changes driven by particular drugs or polysubstance combinations 
					 that skew male?

					I wanted to continue looking at this disparity between sexes. In this stacked density chart of age by sex shows both sexes concentrated between 25–55, but with subtly different shapes. Males peak earlier (around the early 30s) and decline more quickly into the late 40s, suggesting a slightly younger age profile. Females show a broader plateau that extends into the late 40s and early 50s, implying comparatively higher female representation among middle-aged decedents. The tails beyond 60–65 are thin for both groups, and cases under 20 are very few. Because densities are normalized within each sex, the shapes aren’t comparable for overall magnitude. A next step is to overlay counts or weighted densities to reflect the fact that men make up a larger share overall. We will revisit this demographic disparity later, with fentanyl rates.

					From our exploratory data visualizations, we found that fentanyl was a major contributor to overdoses. In this and subsequent charts, I investigate this further in this split time series shows a clear change: fentanyl-positive deaths were negligible until around 2014, then surged sharply and peaked around 2016–2017 with monthly spikes near 75–80. After that peak, fentanyl remained the dominant driver with a high, volatile plateau through 2018–2022, while non-fentanyl deaths trended downward into the single digits. The 2020–2021 period appears elevated and choppy, consistent with pandemic-era disruptions in supply, treatment access, and risk behaviors. From 2023 into 2024 there’s a mild easing in fentanyl counts.

				<figcaption>
					Continuing to investigate fentanyl, I next wanted to know if there were any drugs that was being administered together with fentanyl, which were causing overdoses. In this chart, I wanted to show the crossover, and play with color and value to emphasize this. The strongest hotspots appear for fentanyl + heroin and fentanyl + cocaine, with additional notable pairings involving benzodiazepines and alcohol, consistent with polysubstance patterns that elevate overdose risk. You can also see emerging combinations such as fentanyl + xylazine registering meaningful counts, while classic prescription opioids (oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone) show lighter but present co-mentions with fentanyl. Outside the fentanyl hub, there are smaller clusters suggesting multiple risk constellations beyond a single driver. However co-occurrence reflects substances detected, not causal attribution. I see a useful next step is to facet this matrix by year to see which pairs are rising, and to stratify by age or sex to identify subgroup-specific combinations.

				<figcaption>
					I wanted to deviate a bit and broaded my horizon to look at other variables in the data, specifically location. This chart spotlights hot-spot ZIP codes by total overdose deaths and shows that fentanyl is the majority driver within each. ZIPs 15210 and 15212 carry the largest absolute counts (≈388 and ≈311), with 15132 and 15136 also high, and in all of these areas fentanyl accounts for well over half of deaths—often nearer 60–70%. . To interpret burden fairly, a next step is to convert these counts to rates per 100,000 residents and to compare incident ZIP vs. residence ZIP to distinguish where people live from where deaths occur. I want to highlight the large share that fentanyl takes at each zip code. It would also help to look at monthly trends by ZIP to see whether fentanyl dominance emerged simultaneously or diffused geographically over time, and to stratify by race/sex/age to understand which communities within each ZIP are most affected. I would also like to see if these locations are grouped closely, and examine any potential bias.

				my final chart is an aggregate of my explorations so far, combining my research in fentanyl overdoses and demographic data. This heatmap shows that fentanyl is the majority driver across most race/ethnicity groups for ages 20–59, with the darkest tiles clustering in the young-to-middle adult decades. The 10–19 and 70–79 rows are generally lighter, suggesting a lower fentanyl share among teen and older decedents. Several groups exhibit especially dark tiles in specific decades—indicating fentanyl shares often well above 70%, while White and Black/African American groups look consistently high across multiple age bands. The “Unknown” race column also appears dark but is again hard to derive insights from. Overall, the pattern implies the synthetic-opioid era is widespread rather than confined to a single community, with nuanced differences by age within each group.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Across 7,478 cases from 2018–2025, fatal overdoses in Allegheny County are concentrated among adults 25–55 with a clear male skew across every race group. Time-series analysis shows a structural regime shift beginning 2014–2016 as fentanyl enters and then dominates the drug supply; counts remain elevated through the pandemic period, even as non-fentanyl deaths decline. Fentanyl is the single largest driver, but the polysubstance picture is crucial: frequent co-occurrences include fentanyl + heroin, fentanyl + cocaine, and pairings with benzodiazepines and alcohol. Demographically, White and Black/African American residents bear most of the burden in absolute numbers, and the fentanyl share is high across most age bands from 20–59 for multiple groups, indicating a widespread synthetic-opioid era rather than a problem confined to a single community.

				Three lessons stand out: (1) fentanyl is the dominant risk factor, but co-involved drugs amplify lethality; (2) gender and race disparities persist, with nuanced age patterns that matter for targeting outreach (3) trends are temporal and contextual, with spikes aligned to supply shifts and pandemic disruption. Through this exploration, I learned that how data is shown changes the interpretation of the data to the viewer. Exploratory data analysis allow this designer/programmer to deeply understand the data and highlight trends, and show data accurately. For next steps, I definitely would look like to get the hand of vega-lite and create more complex data visualizations.</p>
